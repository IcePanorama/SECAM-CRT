# SECAM-CRT
A SECAM encoder/decoder written in C++20.

## Acknowledgements

The idea for this project was inspired by [LMP88959's NTSC-CRT project](https://github.com/LMP88959/NTSC-CRT). I'm purposely going out of my way to avoid looking any further into his NTSC implementation as I hope to learn how to do all this totally on my own, but I'd be remiss not to at least give them a shout out here.
